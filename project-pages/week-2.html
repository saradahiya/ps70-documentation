        <div class="main-title">Week 2: 2-D Design & Laser Cutting</div>
        <div class="body-text"> This week I focused on learning how to use Autodesk Fusion, drills, saws and lasers and vinyl cutters.</div>
  
      <div id="project-details">
        <div class="subheader-text"> Box Design  </div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Creating a three-finger joint box with a butterfly vinyl sticker from scratch (with the exception of the cardboard and vinyl material itself) was the greatest feat of my week! I watched the suggested finger joint tutorial presented on the course website but chose to follow a different route by having finger joints around all five of my box’s sides (requiring different configurations for laser cutting and mechanisms for combining the sides), having my own dimesnions for the box and printing and adding a decorative vinyl sticker on it (a collection that I intend to build upon and embellish my box with over the course of the semester!) </div>
          <div class="body-text">Beginner’s luck never struck my laser cutting endeavors and my initial attempt at the box design and cutting process was unfortunately unsuccessful :( I did not realize that my CAD design when saved in the dxf format ended up having different dimensions than the ones initially intended for my box in Fusion. Additionally, I later realised that in the process of clearing out my construction lines I ended up uploading a rudimentary sketch of my box’s base (I printed out all of its sides separately initially) instead of the final sketch which resulted in an incongruous, extremely miniscule and widely disparate set of puzzle pieces instead of a perfectly fitting finger joint box. The second attempt was much to my relief because I readjusted the sizes of my boxes sides, re-outlined the slides, flattened my extruded 3-D model onto one plane for clarity, removed all duplicate sketches (which slowed down the laser cutting process immensely earlier) and accounted for my dxf files properly. This resulted in a very well jointed, finger-pressible box bejeweled endearingly with a red butterfly– the gift of a newly acquired understanding of vinyl sticker making. Throughout this I made use of tools and processes including sketching lines and triangles, extruding shape, parametrizing my box's dimesnions, creating patterns along sides, mirroring, trimming, understanding the concept of kerfs, vinyl and laser cutting</div>
          <div class="body-text">This process ended up being slightly frustrating at times due to my unfamiliarity with Fusion and laser cutting, but overall it was meaningful and informative in helping me find my way around Fusion, and the makerspace including its different equipment and machines. </div>

          <div class="body-text">After watching all the advised video tutorials for Fusion 360, I took a stab at the press-joint box to test my comprehension and practice. Using Fusion for me has had an immensely steep learning curve and I am now beginning to get comfortable with certain tools and functions, albeit very foundational, on the platform. I was having trouble even holding down lines or simple sketches that I drew out but after much trial and error and replaying tutorials (both recommended and recorded in the case of the press fit box), I was able to cleanly create the press fit box.</div>

          <div class="body-text">I chose to measure and model my laundry basket and jewelry box in order to tinker with different functions and design tools in Fusion.</div>

          <div class="body-text">Laundry Basket: I started out by sketching a circular bottom and an elliptical top  for my laundry basket. I connected the two offsetting a new plane off of the circle at the bottom. After doing so I extruded and connected the two shapes to get the body of my laundry basket. In order to draw the curve around the top of the basket I then drew a 3-point arc which I symmetrically extruded inwardly and trimmed to get the bends around the rim of the laundry basket. From there I followed a similar process and drew an ellipse instead of a 3-point arc which I symmetrically extruded inwardly and trimmed to get two elliptical holes for holding my laundry basket. Now that my laundry basket was structurally sound I wanted to make elliptical air outlet covering its body which I kicked off by drawing an ellipse around the basket’s bottom. I then traversed the bottom part of the basket using a circular pattern around the laundry’s basket path. I extended the pattern of ellipses vertically using the rectangular pattern function and marked the boundaries of the basket’s end with a fillet to arrive at my end product.</div>

          <div class="body-text">Jewelry Box: To model my circular jewelry box with a threaded exterior I started off by drawing two circles in the same plane which I connected via extruding. Then I used the thread function to draw out the rings around its body, while trying my hands on other features such as mesh, and fileted it's rims on top and bottom to give it a polished look. I proceeded to focus on the interior by creating a hole to store my jewelry in the box and drawing its insides using the web command. After doing so I created a decorative and symmetrical pattern of spheres around the top of the jewelry box, done through a combination of mirror and pattern tools. At the end, I changed the colors and modified the physical appearance of the box .</div>
